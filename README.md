## How the Game Works

Setting:
In this game you have a player and enemies (bugs) on the paved block portion of the scene that you must avoid.

Goal:
To reach the river without colliding into any one of the bugs.

## Game Rules

1. The player can only move left, right, up and down.
2. There are 5 rounds in total: the buds will move faster in the next round.
3. Once the player collides with an enemy, the game will be reset and the player is put back to the initial square.
4. You will win the game once the player reaches the river in the fifth round.
